Credit Markets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Credit market lies at the heart of finance and allows us to smooth our income
 streams and consumption over time.
 If we earn more than we consume, we can lend our money to someone else
 by putting it into a savings product thereby earning us some future interest
 payment.
 Someone else who earns less than he consumes can then use the capital that
 we deposited and put it to productive use after which he pays back the
 loan plus some interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In traditional finance, there are two main modes in which credit is made
 available.
 On the one hand, we have banks that are allowed to create money to lend
 it out to their customers (as discussed before).
 These banks will typically require some collateral (e.g., a mortgage on your
 house, or in the extreme case, your freedom).
 On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending platforms match savers and borrowers.
 These tend to be looser on requirements and therefore riskier.
 In peer-to-peer lending, all the capital needs to be available a priori.
 In both of these modes, the capital must be returned at predetermined periods
 of time together with ssome interest which can be constant (fixed), or
 depend on some external time-dependent factors (variable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decentralized credit markets offer these functions on the blockchain, but
 differ in that they typically require relatively large amounts of on-chain
 collateral to prove credit-worthiness.
 The reason is, of course, that borrowers tend to be anonymous and as a
 lender we want to avoid someone running off with the principal (the amount
 we lent them).
 Very few regulations exist and there is, therefore, no consumer protection.
 Interestingly, on-chain credit is typically perpetual - meaning that there
 is no fixed limit when a loan ends.
 Interest is paid out continuously and the loan can be paid back in arbitrary
 amounts at arbitrary times.
 Examples of popular credit market protocols are Compound, Aave, dydx, and
 AlphaHomorra.

.
 The smart contract coordinates several actors with different incentives
 and use-cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Savings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, a 
\emph on
saver
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
lender
\emph default
 deposits a 
\emph on
principal
\emph default
 amount to the credit market which accrues interest.
 Typically, she will get a 
\emph on
credit token
\emph default
 that proves her deposit.
 For instance, if she deposits DAI in Compound, she will get cDAI tokens
 of an equivalent amount back (aDAI on Aave, etc.).
 At a later point in time, she can withdraw the principal plus the accrued
 interest by sending her cDAI tokens back to the smart contract.
 As the cDAI tokens are not tied to any one account, a saver can alternatively
 choose to sell the cDAI tokens on an token market as well (see next Chapter).
 Savers form the lifeblood of the credit markets as they are responsible
 for funding the reserves from which loans can be drawn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Borrowing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
borrower
\emph default
 first needs to deposit some collateral to prove that she is credit-worthy.
 This can be done in a similar vein as a savings deposit, the only difference
 being that typically only a select number of reliable tokens are typically
 allowed as 
\emph on
collateral
\emph default
.
 After the deposit, the borrower is then allowed to borrow tokens from the
 credit market up to a certain amount (typically less than the value of
 the collateral).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Oracles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smart contract constantly calculates the value of its assets and its
 liabilities based on internal and external price signals of the tokens
 contained in the market.
 The external price signals are provided by 
\emph on
oracles
\emph default
 which aggregate the price of several different trading platforms to come
 up with a fair estimate.
 This diversity of price signals is necessary as there have been cases of
 heavy price manipulation in single markets which have caused credit markets
 to fail (see the example below).
 Whenever a price change leads to a potential default of a borrower, the
 position is up for liquidation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Liquidation bots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Liquidators
\emph default
 (typically bots) actively monitor positions to see which ones are going
 in default.
 Upon default, they compete for the right to shore up the position by buying
 the debt in return for some of the collateral (and this at a discounted,
 profitable price).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\series bold
Example: 
\series default
in November 2020 a price manipulation caused approximately $89 million in
 liquidations, including some of the most ardent supporters of Compound.
 The issue was that Compound used Coinbase exclusively as a price oracle
 which made it open for manipulation.
 In this particular case, an incredibly large purchase of DAI caused its
 value to shoot up from its (stable) value of $1 to $1.30.
 This caused many DAI debt positions to become increasingly untenable and
 undercollateralized eventually going into default.

\begin_layout Section
Design Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DeFi credit protocols differ in how they are designed.
 In this section, we cover the main vectors of design and what their implication
s are for the usage of the respective platforms.
 Even though governance should be on this list, we will leave a discussion
 on governance for a later chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Collateralization Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
collateral
\series default
 is the sum of assets that you deposit to show your creditworthiness and
 to secure your debt.
 Platforms typically have a minimum requirement expressed as a 
\series bold
collateralization rate (CR)
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{CR}=\frac{\text{Borrowed}}{\text{Deposited}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We say that a position is 
\emph on
over-collateralized
\emph default
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $CR>1$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
under-collateralized
\emph default
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $CR<1$
\end_inset

.
 If a user's collateralization rate drops below the required ratio of a
 platform (e.g., 150% in Aave's case), the position is (partly) liquidated.
 This means that other users are allowed to purchase the collateral and
 the debt at discounted prices.
 In doing so, they save you from going into default and they earn the 
\emph on
liquidation spread
\emph default
.
 Some platforms sell off your full position, but most will only allow partial
 liquidations (e.g., 50% or 25% of the total position).
 The amount that can be liquidated in one go is called the 
\emph on
close factor
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The liquidation process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\series bold
direct liquidation
\series default
, bots monitor the blockchain to check which positions are going in default.
 As soon as a position goes into default, the bot that pays the highest
 gas is allowed to repay the debt (at a discount) and receive collateral.
 This whole process is completed in one single blockchain transaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\series bold
auction-based liquidation
\series default
, bots bid to be able to repay the debt.
 Whoever places the economically most interesting bid is allowed to purchase
 the debt.
 In an 
\emph on
English auction
\emph default
, bidders make offers as to how much they want to pay for the collateral.
 In a 
\emph on
Dutch auction
\emph default
, the asking price starts high and is gradually reduced until someone accepts
 the price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The disadvantage of auctions is that they require active participation of
 bots to work well.

\begin_layout Subsection
Interest rate models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Platforms must constantly balance the supply and demand of different tokens
 that are being deposited and borrowed.
 Tokens that are in high demand (but low supply) naturally should be expensive
 to borrow, and lucrative to deposit.
 Conversely, low-demand tokens with a huge supply in the credit market (e.g.,
 ETH) should be cheap to borrow and non-lucrative to deposit.
 The main mechanism of regulating the cost of borrowing and saving tokens
 is through 
\series bold
interest rate models
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
utilization
\emph default
 of a market 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{m}=\frac{L}{S}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 loans and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 savings.
 A high utilization rate implies that we should make the interest repayments
 high and vice versa.
 Interest rates are rewarded instantaneously but only paid out when a user
 takes an action in the market (interacts with the credit market contract).
 The Interest Rate Index (IRI) at step 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I_{k,m}=I_{k-1,m}(1+rt)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the number of blocks that happened since the previous update (the block
 height) and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the per-block interest rate.
 The total debt is equal to the current debt, plus the outstanding interest:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{k,m}=D_{k-1,m}(1+rt)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a loan is repaid, the outstanding interest is collected by the platform
 and the depositors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Kinked Interest Rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common model for setting interest rates are kinked rates, which
 combine two linear curves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i_{b}=\begin{cases}
\alpha+\beta U & \text{if }U\leq U_{opt}\\
\alpha+\beta U_{opt}+\gamma(U-U_{opt}) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a per-block base rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 a per-block multiplier based on utilization (higher utilization implies
 higher costs to for borrowing the asset and higher interest when depositing
 savings in the asset).

Flash Loans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What it is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flash loans are an extremely exciting technology in which anyone is allowed
 to (temporarily) loan astronomical amounts of assets as long as they manage
 to pay it back within the same transaction (using a smart contract).
 The process is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repay loan collateral + interest

\begin_layout Standard
Fees tend to be relatively high, but the amount that you are allowed to
 borrow is unlimited:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 on the Ethereum blockchain using dydx.
 In this particular arbitrage, the arbitrageur exploited the fact that the
 price of USDC/DAI is different on two different exchanges of the curve
 protocol.
 This mispricing allowed the arbitrageur to bridge the market as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Take out a loan of 2.048M USDC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exchange the 2.048M USDC for 2.028M DAI in market 1 (at price 1.010 USDC/DAI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exchange the 2.028M DAI back to 2.064 M USDC in market 2 (at price 1.018 USDC/DAI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repay the loan 2.028M USDC loan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Profit 16,182 USDC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flash loan has given the arbitrageur a juicy profit without having to
 deposit any funds! Participants of the Curve market are not necessarily
 unhappy as their market has now become more efficient with the USDC/DAI
 price being more equal after the arbitrage.

DeFi attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flash loans are often used in DeFi attacks.
 The attacker borrows a massive amount of tokens to then manipulate the
 price on a market which is used in some other platform as a price oracle
 (as was the case in the previous example on Compound).
 This is the DeFi equivalent of a pump & dump and can be easily resolved
 by using better price signals such as ChainLink oracle technology.
 In further reading, we provide resources to more in-depth examples of this
 type of attack.

 fees that are redirected to fraudulent administrators who can hide these
